# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Project
My group and I created 'Hospital Finder' which actually finds the nearest hospital using shortest path algorithm that is Dijkstra Algorithm. 
Project Title: Hospital Finder
Description
Using the graph traversal ideas that have been taught to us in class, we implement on creating such a program that takes a user’s medical condition and their location and gives them nearby hospitals within a certain radius that specialize in treating their conditions. This will be achieved by using the algorithm taught in class for BFS and Dijkstra. 
•	Our program starts off by taking user input (name, age, sex, things that they are experiencing feeling (symptoms))
•	Based in the most common symptoms person is experiencing, they will be given hospitals nearby within a certain radius (hospitals that treat this condition)
•	Description of each hospital with their contact number, location and what they treat in will be stored in a dictionary and upon finding the nearby hospital, all their info will be given to the user.
Another feature that will be included in our program is an emergency mode. Upon selecting this option, the program will take user location notify nearby hospitals in close proximity to send an ambulance their way. To save time, user information will not be needed. This option can be chosen by those experiencing critical medical condition which does not leave them enough time to search for an ambulance number and will get help for them immediately.
Project Outcome
The aim of our project will be to make sure that patients and users know which hospitals can provide them with the best medical care and this will also help those hospitals receive more patients that they can treat.
Libraries we plan on using
•	Dictionaries
•	Graphs
•	Lists
•	Geopy for maps
•	APIs to get user location
•	Tkinter for GUI implementation of the program
